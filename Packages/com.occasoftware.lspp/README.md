## About

LSPP is a powerful, well-designed, and performant screenspace Volumetric Light Scattering solution targeted for lightweight hardware.
LSPP intelligently determines areas of potential sun occlusion on your screen. It then uses this information to generate god rays (light shafts) from the sun.

By default, the asset uses the main light color as the tint for the fog. You can adjust this tint using the Sun Color Tint parameter.

You can override the main light color and direction using the OverrideLightSettings component. To add this component to an object, click Add Component -> OccaSoftware -> LSPP -> Override Light Settings.

There are also several other exposed shader parameters, including fog density, sample count, max ray distance, tint, and several additional appearance settings.

These settings are all described in the Volume Component system workflow. You can hover over the respective label to understand more about the impact each will have on your scene.

## Documentation

<https://docs.occasoftware.com/lspp>

## Installation Instructions

1. Import the LSPP asset to your project.
2. Navigate to the active Universal Renderer Data asset in use in your project.
3. Click "Add Renderer Feature", and select "Light Scattering Renderer Feature" from the dropdown menu.

## Usage Instructions

1. Navigate to or create a new Global Volume in your scene.
2. Click "Add Override" -> OccaSoftware -> LSPP
3. Configure the Light Scattering post process effect in your scene.

You can change this post-process on the fly in the same way you would modify any other Volume Component integration.
I've included an example script, "ChangeLightScatteringColor.cs" to demonstrate an example of randomly changing the color.

## Troubleshooting

1. Verify that the Light Scattering Render Pass Feature is included in your Universal Renderer Data asset.
2. Verify that you have a Global Volume active in your scene, and that your Camera is not excluding this Volume Layer.
3. Check if your Global Volume includes an LSPP volume override.
4. Ensure that the fog density is sufficiently high, and that your camera is roughly facing the sun direction.
5. Verify that you have MergeLightScattering, Occluders, and LightScattering shaders present in your project and that these Shaders have been compiled.

## Requirements

- This asset is designed for Unity 2022.3 Universal Render Pipeline.
- This asset is not guaranteed to work on other versions of Unity.
- This asset will not work on the Built-In Render Pipeline or the High Definition Render Pipeline.
- If using Unity 6 and forward or forward+ combined with MSAA, the Render Pass Event may have to be set to BeforeRenderingTransparents OR StopNans should be disabled on the camera for a correct behaviour
